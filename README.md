# TheLyrics
Lyrics for many different songs!

## Where do the lyrics come from.
Short version: the song itself. Long[er] version: I listen to the song and try to make out the lyrics, and sometimes compare them against lyrics I find in Google Search results (usually from Musixmatch)

## Where are the songs?
In the [`songs`](/songs) folder.

## How are songs sorted?
They're sorted by artist first (due to songs from different artists but the same name) and then however GitHub sorts them.

## Where can I find other information on the songs?
Also here. Not only does this show lyrics, but also metadata.
