# Levitating
By Dua Lipa

----

If you want to run away
with me I know a galaxy and
I could take you for a ride
I had a preminition that
We fell into a rythm where the
music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky
glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a
Little bit of company you
Met me at the perfect time

You want me
I want you baby
My sugar boo
I'm levitating
The milky way
We're renegading
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I got you
Moonlight
You're mine
starlight
I need you
All night
come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I got you
Moonlight
You're mine
starlight
I need you
All night
come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
